                <p class="articleTimestamp">16 April 2020 at 11:00AM</p>
                <p>During these trying times, we here at Royal Wireless know that times are tough. Because of this, we have made this decision
                    to offer all of our existing customers unlimited data throughout the duration of the pandemic. We know that many of our customers
                    utilize their mobile data for work, school, or to stay in touch with loved ones. We hope that by offering this to our customers,
                    we will make at least one part of the pandemic a little easier.
                </p>
                <p>We hope that all of you are staying safe, healthy, and informed on the best ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Take care.</p>

                    cell towers in order to provide you with great service.
